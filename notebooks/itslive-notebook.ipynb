    "### [Global Ice Velocities](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) project facilitates ice sheet, ice shelf and glacier research by providing a globally comprehensive and temporally dense multi-sensor record of land ice velocity and elevation with low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Velocity granules\n",
    "    \n",
    "All image pairs are processed using the JPL autonomous Repeat Image Feature Tracking algorithms (auto-RIFT), first presented in (Gardner et al., 2018). Release v00.0 of the ITS_LIVE velocity mosaics use auto-RIFT Version 1. This ITS_LIVE data set uses surface displacements generated by image pairs  in repeat orbits, and image pairs generated by overlap areas of adjacent or near-adjacent orbits. Image pairs collected from the same satellite position (\"same-path-row\") are searched if they have a time separation of fewer than 546 days. This approach was used for all satellites in the Landsat series (L4 to L8). To increase data density prior to the launch of Landsat 8, images acquired from differing satellite positions, generally in adjacent or near-adjacent orbit swaths (\"cross-path-row\"), are also processed if they have a time separation between 10 and 96 days and an acquisition date prior to 14 June 2013(beginning of regular Landsat 8 data). Feature tracking of cross-path-row image pairs produces velocity fields with a lower signal-to-noise ratio due to residual parallax from imperfect terrain correction. Same-path-row and cross-path-row preprocessed pairs of images are searched for matching features by finding local normalized cross-correlation (NCC) maxima at sub-pixel resolution by oversampling the correlation surface by a factor of 16 using a Gaussian kernel. A sparse grid pixel-integer NCC search (1/16 of the density of full search grid) is used to determine areas of coherent correlation between image pairs. For more information, see the Normalized Displacement Coherence (NDC) filter described in Gardner et al. (2018)\n",

    "Scene-pair velocities generated from satellite optical and radar imagery.\n",

    "* Coverage: All land ice\n",

    "### Search API\n",
    "\n",
    "The *itslive-search* API hosted at NSIDC allows us to find granules of interest. Because of its high temporal and spatial resolution, ITS_LIVE data amounts to 8+ million NetCDF files stored in AWS S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This API returns a list of the granule's URLs on AWS S3 that match our search criteria not the actual data itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main parameters are the area and time of interest and others that are dataset-especific like the percentage of valid data on each image pair. To visualize how the spatial matching works take a look at the following figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial matching\n",
    "<div align=\"left\"> \n",
    "<img src='./img/itslive-selection.png' height='160px'/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "ITS_LIVE data com from multiple scenes and satellites, which means a lot of overlap. In this case all the scenes that match with our spatial criteria will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **For practical reasons, it's better to search on a glacier scale rather than larger areas. This notebook will use Pine Island Glacier for demo purposes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **polygon/bbox**: LON-LAT pairs separated by a comma.\n",
    "* **start**: YYYY-mm-dd start date\n",
    "* **end**: YYYY-mm-dd end date\n",
    "* **min_separation**: minimum days of separation\n",
